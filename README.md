# PDO Connection Brackets Extension
[üêò] This repository contains an extension developed to help bracket users to create their pdo connections in PHP.


I was always interested in create something for an open source software, so I choosed brackets to do it =).

# Why Brackets?
Particularly, I really like web development, and as brackets is a text editor used in the most part of the time for web development
I've decided to study more about the extensions development and create something useful for PHP.

# How to use?

If you press Alt + Y the extension will give you the following code: ConInfo(host:::YourHostHere:::dbname:::YourDbNameHere:::user:::YourUserHere:::pass:::YourPasswordHere);
You just have to change the informations according to your connection info.

Then you just have to press Alt + T and your connection code will just appear in your screen =).

Thank you for have interest in my extension, please leave a feedback.
